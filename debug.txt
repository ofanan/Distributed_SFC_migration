Lux 144 causes seg. fault. Last written period is t = 30061.
However, for some reason, .res is written only up to to t = 30043. 
Prob' because "filling buf" / "silly window" issue, beacuse some "error" pints that the prog. fails indeed only later, due to seg. fault.
Hence, start logging only in t = 30062.
the seg. flt. happens after the end of conclude time period 30062, and b4 the beginning of 30063.

New error:
!> Error: Model error: t=30063.000: at rdOldUsrsLine, old usr 631 wasn't placed yet
chain 631 appears in the trace as a new chain in 30019, and moves (as an old chain) for the first time in 30063.
Indeed, by the log, this chain isn't placed in 30063.
Now checking whether it's placed in 30019.
Check shows, that this chain is blocked in 30019.
Hence, it should appear as blocked also in 30063. Let's check this.
Fixed it! compushing.
