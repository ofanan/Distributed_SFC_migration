traceT=30024.000000 : checkChainsMasterData() : c160 found in s101.placedChain is recorded in ChainsMaster as placed on s-1 -- in module (SimController) 
t = 30023:
S160 was placed on s5. 

t = 30024:
s1597 : rcvd vecOfChainsThatJoined=,160. 
c160 notAssigned in s1597, s101, s26, s6, s1, s0.
s0 : blocked chain 160
So wy isn't that reflected in ChainsMasterData?
But how is it blocked, if it was already placed on s160 in the previous period?
Because it's a chain that left, and re-joined as "new".

ln. 5264: 
s0 : blocked chain 160
ln. 5940: 
c160 still appears in s101's placed chains. Why wasn't it removed as a "chain that left"?
Probably because it didn't appear in the chainsmaster. 
At t = 30023:
ChainsMasterData:

Also: should add a check whether a placed chain is actually blocked.

Need to send info about blocked chain down, to verify that it's not placed somewhere below.
Also: seems we have to wait b4 running finReshAsync after sending reshAsyncReq to the last child.
