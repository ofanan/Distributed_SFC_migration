But s983 doesn't know it was pushed-up - probably because the reshuffling node in the middle blocked the msg.
The bug: we forgot to regain rsrc from pushed-up chains also while in f mode.
Fixed.
Next bug:
s769 doesn't know that its chain was pushed-up, because it checks for its "pot-placed chains." However, during a resh, s769 may have deleted its pot-placed chains.
Or - because it doesn't even checks whether it was pushed-up. Need not only to regain - but to finally place. Does it do it?
Yes, he does.
Now checking, why potPlacedChains was deleted from s769.
