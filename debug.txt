traceT=30449.000000 : checkChainsMasterData() : c728 found in s398.placedChain is recorded in ChainsMaster as placed on s9 -- in module (SimController)

c728 is potPlaced on s398. Hence, it appears in its PUL. 
Later, s398 reshuffles (not clear why it reshuffles after it finished BU, because it's a leaf).
During the resh, s398 places the potPlaced chain, c728.
Later, s398's ancestor, s9, push-ups s398 to itsef. 
s9 informs its son, s37, about this push-up.
