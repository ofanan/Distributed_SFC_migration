Lux 144 causes seg. fault. Last written period is t = 30061.
However, for some reason, .res is written only up to to t = 30043. 
Prob' because "filling buf" / "silly window" issue, beacuse some "error" pints that the prog. fails indeed only later, due to seg. fault.
Hence, start logging only in t = 30062.
