# Distributed_SFC_migration

This project implements a distributed asynchronous protocol for the deployment and migration of Micro-Services (MSs) in the edge-cloud continuum. 
The protocol is implemented using the Omnet++ simulator, and is based on real-world antenna location, and on SUMO (Simulator of Urban MObility).
