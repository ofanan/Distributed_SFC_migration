# Distributed_SFC_migration

This project studies distributed algorithms for the deployment and migration of VMs (SFC) in the edge-cloud continuum. 
It includes Omnet++ simulations, and is based on real-world antenna location, and on SUMO (Simulator of Urban MObility).

More details would be provided once an academic paper is accepted for publication. Stay tuned.
