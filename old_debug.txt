Lux 144 causes seg. fault. Last written period is t = 30061.
However, for some reason, .res is written only up to to t = 30043. 
Prob' because "filling buf" / "silly window" issue, beacuse some "error" pints that the prog. fails indeed only later, due to seg. fault.
Hence, start logging only in t = 30062.
the seg. flt. happens after the end of conclude time period 30062, and b4 the beginning of 30063.

New error:
!> Error: Model error: t=30063.000: at rdOldUsrsLine, old usr 631 wasn't placed yet
chain 631 appears in the trace as a new chain in 30019, and moves (as an old chain) for the first time in 30063.
Indeed, by the log, this chain isn't placed in 30063.
Now checking whether it's placed in 30019.
Check shows, that this chain is blocked in 30019.
Hence, it should appear as blocked also in 30063. Let's check this.
Fixed it! compushed.
However, still seg. fault, while reading old users in t=30063.
It happens when reading old user 629.
This user was old already in 30063. Hence, now starting debugging from 30060.
30060: 629 is placed on s197.
30062: 629 is placed on s197.
But now the prob' in 30063 appears after reading 479. Namely, while reading 480.
Checking in the .res blocked users.
Fixed it! compushed.
However, now still, in t=30063, successfully reads old users only up to chainId 621 --> fails to read 629.
Checking that again in the trace. In t=30062, 629 was "old", and stored on s197.
Now checking whether c629 was blocked. So, printing only info about blocked chains.
For some reason, while the log shows that there where blocked chain, it doesn't print the "blocked chain %d" msg.

Also, trying to understand: why is the last traceTime written to .res 30043?
Maybe it's the usual "buffer" issue: the relevant code is visited, but the prints are not done immediately.
This only happens sometimes when NOT printing error from SimController::printResLine (). when printing from there, Opt stops only at 30062 / 30063.

ToDo: check whether initBottomUp and/or missing handling of "old" potPlacedChains causes seg. flt.
